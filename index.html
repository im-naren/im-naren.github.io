                <p>Welcome to DevelByte â€” my little corner of the internet where code meets caffeine.</p>
                
                <p>I'm <strong>Narendra Dubey</strong>, a full-stack tech tinkerer who's been breaking (and fixing) things in the software world for over a decade. From debugging late-night production fires to building <span class="highlight">data pipelines</span> that don't collapse under load, I've learned a thing or two about what makes good code tick.</p>
                
                <p>Around here, you'll find a mix of <span class="highlight">coding tips</span>, productivity hacks, <span class="highlight">system design</span> rants, job-hunt strategies, and even the occasional salary-negotiation battle log. Think of it as a nerd's survival guide to thriving in tech without losing your sanity.</p>
                
                <p>I'm not here to preach from the mountaintop â€” I still Google half my solutions daily â€” but I'll share war stories, lessons learned, and random experiments that (sometimes) actually work.</p>
                
                <p>So whether you're a fresh grad writing your first "Hello, World!" or a grizzled engineer scaling distributed systems, pull up a chair. Let's ship code, break things, learn fast, and maybe even laugh at a few bugs along the way. ðŸš€</p>
