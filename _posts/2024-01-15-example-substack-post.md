👋🏼 Hey everyone!

Welcome to the **new home** of DevelByte! If you've been following along on [Substack](https://develbyte.substack.com/), you'll feel right at home here.

## Why the Move?

I wanted more control over the design and content organization. Plus, as developers, we love our custom setups, right? This Jekyll blog gives me the flexibility to:

- **Better organize content** by categories and tags
- **Faster loading** and better SEO
- **Custom features** that I can build myself
- **Open source** - you can even see the [source code](https://github.com/im-naren/develbyte.github.io)!

## What to Expect

The same authentic, no-BS content you've come to expect:

- 💻 **Engineering insights** from the trenches
- 🚀 **Career advice** that actually works
- 🛠️ **Productivity hacks** for developers
- 📈 **Management tips** for technical leaders

And yes, I'll still be Googling things daily and sharing my occasional blunders! 😅

## Moving Forward

All the existing Substack content will be gradually migrated here. If you have a favorite post you'd like to see moved over first, just let me know!

Thanks for being part of this journey. Whether you're debugging your 100th deployment issue today or finally getting that promotion you've been working towards, I'm here to help.

Now, let's get back to building amazing things! 🚀
